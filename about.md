I love learning. Recently I’ve been especially excited about learning programming. 

Seriously. It’s so empowering! You can build amazing things quickly. You can create a company from scratch if that’s what you want to do. 

And beyond that, the big ideas behind programming--ideas like abstraction and encapsulation--give you a powerful vocabulary and skill set for understanding and solving just about any problem.
