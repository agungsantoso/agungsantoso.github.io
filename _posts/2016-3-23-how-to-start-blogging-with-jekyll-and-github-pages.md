title: How to Start Blogging with Jekyll and GitHub Pages
---

Inspired from many blogs built using GitHub Pages, I start to search how to quickly build the blog using Jekyll and GitHub Pages.
Then I found [article from smashing magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) explain about this.

Based on that article, there are only 4 steps to start blogging on GitHub Pages.

1. Fork [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) repo
2. Rename it to your username.github.io
3. Customize your blog using `_config.yml`
4. Create your first blog post using markdown syntax
